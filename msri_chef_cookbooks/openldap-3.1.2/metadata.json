{"name":"openldap","version":"3.1.2","description":"Installs and configures OpenLDAP (slapd) an open source implementation of LDAP.","long_description":"# openldap Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openldap.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openldap) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/openldap.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/openldap)\n\nConfigures a server to be an OpenLDAP master or replication slave. Also includes a recipe to install the client libs, but not to setup actual LDAP auth as there are several ways to do this. We recommend looking at our [sssd_ldap cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/sssd_ldap)\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Ubuntu\n- Debian\n- FreeBSD\n- RHEL/CentOS\n- Fedora\n- openSUSE Leap\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- dpkg_autostart\n\n## Attributes\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of attributes as most are directly comparable to their OpenLDAP equivalents.\n\n### Required\n\n- `openldap['rootpw']`\n\nThis should be a password hash generated from slappasswd. The default slappasswd command will generate a salted SHA1 hash:\n\n```\n$ slappasswd -s \"secretsauce\"\n{SSHA}6BjlvtSbVCL88li8IorkqMSofkLio58/\n```\n\nSet this via a node/role/env attribute or in a wrapper cookbook with an encrypted data_bag. OpenLDAP will fail to start if this is not set.\n\n### Install/Upgrade\n\n- `openldap['package_install_action']` - The action to be taken for all packages in the recipes. Defaults to :install, but can also be set to :upgrade to upgrade all packages referenced in the recipes.\n\n### General configuration\n\n- `openldap['schemas']` - Array of ldap schema file names to load\n- `openldap['modules']` - Array of slapd modules names to load\n\n### TLS/SSL\n\nIf `openldap['ldaps_enabled']` or `openldap['tls_enabled']` are set, then `openldap['tls_cert']` and `openldap['tls_key']` must also be set and the files must exist prior to execution. Depending on the certificates, `openldap['tls_cafile']` may also need to be set. See the test cookbook for an example.\n\n- `openldap['ldaps_enabled']` - listen on LDAPS (636) true | false (default)\n- `openldap['tls_enabled']` - true | false (default)\n- `openldap['tls_cert']` - full path to your SSL certificate\n- `openldap['tls_key']` - full path to your SSL key\n- `openldap['tls_cafile']` - full path to your CA certificate (or intermediate authorities), if needed.\n- `openldap['tls_ciphersuite']` - OpenSSL cipher suite specification to use, defaults to none (use system default)\n\n### Replication\n\nAttributes related to replication (syncrepl). Only used if a provider or consumer.\n\n- `openldap['slapd_type']` - `'provider' | 'consumer'`, default is `nil`\n- `openldap['slapd_provider']` - hostname of slapd provider\n- `openldap['slapd_replpw']` - replication password\n- `openldap['slapd_rid']` - unique integer ID, required if type is consumer\n- `openldap['syncrepl_interval']` - interval for the sync. Defaults to 1 day\n- `openldap['syncrepl_type']` - defaults to 'refreshAndPersist'\n- `openldap['syncrepl_filter']` - search filter to use in the replication\n- `openldap['syncrepl_use_tls']` - `yes | no (default)`\n- `openldap['syncrepl_cn']` - the CN (only) of the user to use as binddn as consumer\n\n## Recipes\n\n### default\n\nInstall and configure OpenLDAP (slapd).\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
